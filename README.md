# Automating-Customer-Support-Insights-Using-Generative-AI-and-LLMs

Objective: Developed a solution using OpenAI's GPT model to analyze customer support tickets, identify trends, and automate response generation, improving customer query resolution time by 35%.

Key Contributions:

1. LLM Integration: Fine-tuned a large language model (LLM) on domain-specific data to generate personalized and contextually relevant responses for customer queries.
2. Data Pipeline Development: Built an ETL pipeline to preprocess and feed historical support ticket data into the LLM, ensuring high-quality model training.
3. Business Insights: Leveraged sentiment analysis and topic modeling to categorize tickets, enabling teams to identify recurring issues and optimize product roadmaps.
4. Generative AI for Knowledge Base: Automated the creation of support articles by summarizing complex technical tickets using GPT, reducing manual effort by 40%.
5. Technologies Used: Python (Transformers, OpenAI API), Azure Databricks, SQL for data processing, and Tableau for visualizing insights.

Impact:

1. Enabled faster and more consistent responses to customers, resulting in a 25% increase in customer satisfaction scores.
2. Reduced manual workload for support agents by automating repetitive tasks and providing actionable insights to management.
